# axial_piston_pump
For the recreation of the Axial Piston Pump Model, you require the basic input parameter from which we will get another parameter to generate a 3D Model. It helps to generate smooth and parametric geometry. In IceSL, there will be one tweak box that allows the user to change input parameters as shown below.
